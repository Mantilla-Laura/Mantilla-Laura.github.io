        <h3>Address:</h3><p id="demo1"></p>
        <h3>Telephone:</h3><p id="demo2"></p>
        <h3>Services:</h3><p id="demo3"></p>
        <h3>History:</h3><p id="demo4"></p> <p> At just 10,500 square feet, the Laie Hawaii Temple was the smallest temple the Church had ever constructed, though it has since been enlarged to over 40,000 square feet.<br>

                The Laie Hawaii Temple was originally named the Hawaii Temple.<br>
                
                The Laie Hawaii Temple stands adjacent to Church-owned Brigham Young University–Hawaii. The Church's other two universities; Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and Brigham Young University–Idaho in Rexburg, Idaho; also have adjacent temples.<br>
                
                The Laie Hawaii Temple sits on the original Mormon landholdings of Hawaii known as Laie Plantation. The 6,000-acre parcel was purchased in 1865 for $14,000.<br>
                
                President Joseph F. Smith was in Hawaii on business in the spring of 1915 when he was moved by a spiritual impulse to dedicate a site for the Laie Hawaii Temple. The action was later ratified by the brethren and publicly sustained in the October 1915 General Conference.<br>
                
                Before construction of the Laie Hawaii Temple could begin, the existing 30-by-90-foot chapel had to be relocated over a period of days using jacks, tackle, ropes, horses, steel pipe, and timbers to pull and push the nine-ton building down the hill. The building was later lost to fire on July 11, 1940, during a renovation project.<br>
                
                Construction of the Laie Hawaii Temple came to a standstill when the supply of lumber ran out. Prayers were uttered, and two days later, a freighter was discovered stranded on a nearby coral reef. The captain offered his entire cargo to the saints if they would unload it for him. His cargo? Lumber—enough to complete the temple.<br>
                
                The concrete exterior of the temple was created using crushed rock and coral.<br>
                
                The Laie Hawaii Temple is one of six temples built with no towers or spires. (The others are the Cardston Alberta Temple, the Mesa Arizona Temple, the Paris France Temple, the Meridian Idaho Temple, and the Lima Peru Los Olivos Temple.)<br>
                
                Carved friezes, created by sculptor Avard Fairbanks, decorate each side of the top of the temple, depicting four dispensations of time: Old Testament Dispensation (west), New Testament Dispensation (south), Book of Mormon Dispensation (north), and Latter-day Dispensation (east).<br>
                
                The Laie Hawaii Temple was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day by President Heber J. Grant, just one year after the passing of President Joseph F. Smith who had dedicated the site and had served as a missionary in Hawaii at the tender age of 15.<br>
                
                The Laie Hawaii Temple was dedicated sixteen years before the creation of the first Hawaiian stake on Oahu in 1935.<br>
                
                The Laie Hawaii Temple features beautiful hand-painted murals on the walls of its progressive-style ordinance rooms: Creation Room, Garden Room, World Room, Terrestrial Room (no murals), and Celestial Room (no murals).<br>
                
                The Laie Hawaii Temple is one of only seven temples where patrons progress through four ordinance rooms before passing into the Celestial Room. (The other six temples are the Manti Utah Temple, the Salt Lake Temple, the Cardston Alberta Temple, the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple, the Los Angeles California Temple, and the Nauvoo Illinois Temple.)<br>
                
                In May 1976, the Laie Hawaii Temple closed for two years for extensive remodeling that provided a new front entrance, enlarged patron and administrative facilities, and converted the progressive-style ordinance rooms to stationary rooms equipped for motion-picture presentation of the endowment.<br>
                
                In December 2008, the Laie Hawaii Temple closed again for two years for structural and seismic upgrades and for restoration of the ordinance rooms to their original progressive-style presentation of the endowment (still using film). The baptistry was repaired and renovated.
